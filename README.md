# 6-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This weather app is a useful tool to see current weather and a five day forcast of a city you search for. It pulls live data from openweathermap api and stores your search history in local storage.

===>I need to note that although UV index was a requirement, openweathermap has deprecated it:

https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi

===>I am also seeing a mixed content error when the page loads from github. From what I read it has to do with openweathermap free version api using http vs github https. When loaded locally you'll find the data loads without issue.

## Installation

Nothing to install. Simply visit my github page:
https://bill-hennessey.github.io/6-Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

Type in the city in which you would like to see weather data at the top right. The main setion will display current weather, scroll down for a five day forcast.
